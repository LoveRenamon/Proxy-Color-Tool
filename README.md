# Proxy-Color-Tool
A color tool for *_Garry's Mod_* that add more _7 proxies_ and allow you to set then individualy across different entities for each model.
Since this utilizes material proxies and *may* cause some _*FPS* drop_ on the *CLIENT*. Have not observed any severe drop at all though.

## Information
