# Proxy-Color-Tool
Color tool for Garry's Mod that allows 6 different colors on a model.
This utilizes material proxies and *may* cause some FPS drop on the client. Have not observed any drop at all though.

**material proxies are used on playermodels for color and weapons like the physgun for color**
This addon just creates 6 more proxies for model use.
