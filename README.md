# Proxy-Color-Tool
Color tool for Garry's Mod that allows 6 different colors on a model.

This utilizes material proxies and may cause some FPS drop on the client. Ive done my best to optimize it so it shouldnt be that bad, but my code is not the greatest so any help with it would be greatly appreciated!
